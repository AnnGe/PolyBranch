### Open Source!

GUI built with HTML5 and [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

Font is [Wire One](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Wire+One) from [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts)

## Prizes

We have 5 shiny new iPads with Retina displays (64GB wifi models) to give to our winners (or Apple Store Credit equivalent). Runners up will receive GitHub swag of their choice ($100 credit for the [GitHub Shop](http://shop.github.com/)). If you have a team submission, we'll give you Apple Store credit equal to the value of the iPad. You can split it with your teammates as appropriate.

All of the winners and runners up will be showcased on our blog.
